# 🧘 Siddhartha

**The Native Mac Markdown Editor for Finding Your Flow.**

> "Writing is good, thinking is better. Coding is best." — *Probably not Hermann Hesse.*

Siddhartha is a **native macOS** writing app built for speed, simplicity, and sanity. No Electron bloat. No subscription fees. Just you, your words, and a SwiftData backend that saves faster than you can blink.

## ✨ Why Siddhartha?

We got tired of writing apps that take 10 seconds to launch. Siddhartha is built with **SwiftUI** and **SwiftData**, making it instant, lightweight, and crash-resistant.

It is designed to be a competitor to the big dogs (looking at you, Ulysses), but built in a few furious sessions of "Vibe Coding."

## 🚀 Features (That Actually Work)

* **📝 Live Markdown Rendering:** Syntax highlighting for headers, bold, and more. It looks good while you type.
* **💾 Trust-Based Auto-Save:** Powered by SwiftData. Quit the app whenever you want; your words are already safe.
* **🖼️ Image Support:** Insert local images into your docs. We handle the file management so you don't have to.
* **📄 Native PDF Export:** One-click export that actually handles images and layout correctly (even if you write in Dark Mode).
* **🌘 Dark Mode Ready:** Because writing at 2 AM requires a dark theme.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

Built entirely natively for the Apple ecosystem.

* **Language:** Swift 5.9
* **UI Framework:** SwiftUI (with AppKit bridging for the heavy lifting)
* **Database:** SwiftData (Persistent, crash-proof storage)
* **Export Engine:** PDFKit + CoreGraphics

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run It

1. **Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Siddhartha.git

```


2. **Open in Xcode:**
Double-click `Siddhartha.xcodeproj`.
3. **Run:**
Hit `Cmd + R` to build and run on your Mac.

## 🔮 The Roadmap (Coming Soon)

* [ ] **Focus Mode:** One click to banish the UI and just write.
* [ ] **EPUB Export:** Publish your book directly from the app.
* [ ] **Unit Tests:** (Wait, we actually added those already! ✅)
